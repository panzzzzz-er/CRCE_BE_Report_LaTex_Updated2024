\subsection{Future Enhancements}
\par The future vision of WSNs is to embed numerous distributed devices to monitor and interact with physical world phenomena, and to exploit spatially and temporally dense sensing and actuation capabilities of those sensing devices. These nodes coordinate among themselves to create a network that performs higher-level tasks.
\par Further reasearch is needed to modify the existing routing protocols to provide QOS. In genetics, Particle swarm optimization \gls {pso} can be used to develop the algorithm for packet scheduling.
